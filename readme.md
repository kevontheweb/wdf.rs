Wave Digital Filter library `ðŸ¦€ xXx_WrITteN_iN_rUsT_xXx ðŸ¦€`

- I did my final year electronic engineering project on an digital guitar amplifier using wave digital filters.

- It ran on a single board computer in real-time and sounded alright (imo).

- I'm rewriting the library part of it in rust, for the memes and for fun.

- I'll do a few example circuits from the research papers I used [[0](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/papers/virtual-analog-modeling-of-audio-circuitry-using-wave-digital-filters)].

- Maybe I'll get the [stuff that I couldn't get right last year [[3](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2209789.2209937), [4](https://github.com/NikolajAndersson/TriodeModel)].

- I hope I can get it to a usable state. Maybe I'll make a mwe using nih_plug or something ðŸ¤·.
